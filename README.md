[![Rust CI/CD](https://github.com/nogibjj/Alicia_miniproject8/actions/workflows/rustCI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Alicia_miniproject8/actions/workflows/rustCI.yml)
---
**Goal**

Swap a Python Script in Rust and compare their performance on running time, memory usage and CPU usage.

---

**file**

Original Python code in the following files:
* main.py
* test_main.py
Rust code in the following files:
* src\main.rs
* src\lib.py
These files enable the creation of a simple dataset and the calculation of its descriptive statistics in Pyhton and Rust
